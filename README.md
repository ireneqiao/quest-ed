### Background

Parents of pediatric cancer patients at the Duke Children's Hospital are given a handbook on the information that they need to know -- what cancer is, how cancer can be treated, and what they can do to take care of their child while they undergo treatment. However, there are no such defined resources for understanding cancer available to the patients themselves. This is an issue because these children might have a hard time understanding such a complex disease and the series of treatments that they have to undergo, which can cause them to be scared and unwilling to accept treatment, or struggle to cope with their illness.

This project attempts to create a game that is part of a made-up world in which these children have different levels to pass in order to win the overall game. Each level helps teach a particular concept related to cancer, where they wath a video related to that concept, play a fun game, and then complete a short quiz. If made successfully, this game will help reinforce concepts taught in the video of the level and also provide entertainment so that users have fun and are distracted from their illness.

### Dependencies

### Deployment

The two games that we developed for this project are not meant to be standalone apps, but rather minigames within our client's QuestED app, and the integration of our games into the larger project is to be handled by our client.
